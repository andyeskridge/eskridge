title: Conflict-free replicated data types
description: A conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) is a data type that can be replicated across multiple computers and used concurrently by multiple users, with the guarantee that, as long as the operations are commutative and associative, the result will be the same regardless of the order in which the operations were performed.

## What is a CRDT?

A conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) is a data type that can be replicated across multiple computers and used concurrently by multiple users, with the guarantee that, as long as the operations are commutative and associative, the result will be the same regardless of the order in which the operations were performed.

## Why do we need CRDTs?

CRDTs are useful for building distributed systems. They allow multiple users to collaborate on the same data without having to worry about conflicts. This is because the data is stored in a way that allows multiple users to make changes to it without having to worry about conflicts.
