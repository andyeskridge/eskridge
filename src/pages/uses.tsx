              I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
              difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
              single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it
              through with our various launch simulations.

              I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features
              everyone else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text
              editor ever made.

              Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
              organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
              Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
              discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
              daily note.
